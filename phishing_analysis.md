## Summary
This message is a classic phishing template designed to trick recipients into giving up credentials or clicking a malicious link. Multiple indicators point to a high probability of phishing. Below is a structured analysis of the suspicious indicators, risks, header analysis, and recommended actions.

---

## 1. High-level verdict
*Phishing (High probability).* Multiple indicators (spoofed sender domain, urgency, suspicious link, generic greeting) strongly suggest this is not a legitimate email from SBI.

---

## 2. Suspicious indicators (what to look for)
- *Sender domain mismatch / spoofed domain*
  - Shown sender: support@sbi-secure-login.com  
  - Official SBI domains use sbi.co.in, onlinesbi.com, or other SBI-managed domains. sbi-secure-login.com is not an official SBI domain and is crafted to look similar.
- *Urgent and threatening language*
  - Phrases like “verify within 24 hours” and “account will be temporarily suspended” create pressure to act quickly — a common social-engineering tactic.
- *Generic greeting*
  - Uses “Dear SBI Customer” rather than addressing the recipient by name — legitimate bank communications are often personalized.
- *Suspicious URL*
  - Displayed link: https://sbi-secure-login.com/verify-account — not the bank’s official domain. Hovering the link (in a real client) would reveal the actual destination; often the link displayed and the real target differ.
- *No contextual/account details*
  - No partial account number or transaction details are included that the bank could reasonably provide to authenticate the message.
- *Reply-To and From use the same suspicious domain*
  - Both From and Reply-To point to the fake domain—attackers may capture replies directly.
- *Lack of official contact or guidance*
  - No official phone number or instruction to use the bank’s official site (bank usually instructs users to log in via official channels).

## 3. Header Analysis (simulated example)
*Simulated headers used for analysis:*

Received: from unknown123.hosting.com (unknown123.hosting.com [185.199.220.55]) by mail.sbi.co.in (Postfix) with ESMTP id 1234ABCD for you@yourdomain.com; Mon, 22 Sep 2025 10:15:23 +0530 (IST) From: "State Bank of India" support@sbi-secure-login.com Reply-To: no-reply@sbi-secure-login.com Return-Path: bounce@sbi-secure-login.com Date: Mon, 22 Sep 2025 10:15:20 +0530 Message-ID: 20250922101520.ABCDEF@unknown123.hosting.com

*What an online header analyzer would reveal*
- *Received-from mismatch:* The sending server (unknown123.hosting.com [185.199.220.55]) is not an official SBI mail server. Legitimate SBI mail would come from SBI-managed infrastructure/domains.
- *From vs Return-Path:* Both are the fake domain (sbi-secure-login.com), indicating the sender is using its own domain for bounce/reply handling rather than an SBI domain.
- *Message-ID:* Generated by the attacker’s server (unknown123.hosting.com) — not an SBI domain.
- *SPF/DKIM/DMARC:* In a real header check these would likely *fail* or be misaligned because the sending IP is not authorized to send mail for sbi.co.in. Failing SPF or DKIM is a strong sign of forgery.
- *Conclusion from headers:* The headers show the email originated from infrastructure unrelated to SBI and will likely fail standard email authentication checks — confirming it is forged/spoofed.

---

## 4. Technical checks you could perform (safe methods)
- Paste the full raw headers into an online header analyzer (e.g., MXToolbox or Google Admin Toolbox) to confirm Received chain and SPF/DKIM/DMARC status.
- Use a domain lookup (WHOIS) or online reputation check to see domain registration date — phishing domains are often newly created.
- Do *not* click links in a normal browser; use an isolated sandbox or domain-checking tools to inspect the target URL.

---

## 5. Risks if a user clicks or interacts
- *Credential theft:* redirected to a fake login page that captures credentials.
- *Account takeover:* attackers use stolen credentials to access funds or reset other linked accounts.
- *Malware:* links can trigger downloads that install banking trojans or remote access malware.
- *Information harvesting:* attacker collects more personal data for subsequent targeted attacks.

---

## 6. Recommended user actions
- *Do not click any links* in the email and do not reply.
- *Verify sender authenticity* using headers and SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks.
- *Open the bank’s official site manually* (type https://www.onlinesbi.com or https://www.sbi.co.in) and check notifications from there.
- *Contact the bank* using official phone numbers from its website (not any contact details in the email).
- *Report the email* to SBI and/or your internal security team.
- *Change passwords & enable MFA* if you clicked and entered credentials.
- *Run antivirus scans* if you downloaded or opened anything.
